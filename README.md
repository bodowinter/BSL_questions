# BSL_questions

Analysis of BSL question data. The `scripts` folder contains all knitted and non-knitted markdown files. The file `preprocessing.Rmd` is supposed to be run first. It creates the file `BSL_questions_cleaned.csv` which is used by all other scripts. All scripts rely on  `question_helper_functions.R` that contains plotting functions and other helper functions for this project.
